# sentiment-analysis-RNN

This is a NLP project related to my Deep Learning class, as part of my MSc Data Science at Ecole Polytechnique.

I worked with my classmate Tommy Tran to analyse movie reviews from the Rotten Tomatoes website (data obtained from a [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/c/sentiment-analysis-on-movie-reviews) competition).

In our report we present how we dealt with the data and implemented different deep learning neural networks, in order to classify the main sentiment in each review. We went through the following steps:
* Data exploration and visualization
* Data preprocessing: one-hot encoding, tokenization, padding, embedding
* Deep Learning models: LSTM, GRU, Bi-directionnal GRU, CNN
* Baseline machine learning models: logistic regression, SVM, Voting classifier
